An open-source, iOS app for viewing sounding data and forecasts from NOAA

# What's a Skew-T Log-P?
If weather is the Matrix, reading a Skew-T Log-P chart is reading the green text. Metereologists and glider pilots understand. All pilots should!

## üìà The lines
The two plotted lines are temperature (red) and moisture/dew point (blue). Height is height. (Pressure altitude is plotted logarithmically, hence Log-P). Left is cold; right is hot. Temperature is skewed so that a constant temperature atmosphere would slope up and to the right, hence Skew-T.

![Temperature line example](https://github.com/jasonn85/Skewt/assets/1328743/a8de626d-3a9e-4129-8153-b1dec61b286b)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Lines touch = clouds
The temperature falling to the dew point makes clouds/dew/precipitation. This would be shown as the temperature plot touching or nearly touching the dew point plot.

Here is a low marine layer of clouds:

And a thick layer of rain:

## üìê The other lines
All sorts of other weather characteristics are easily identifiable on a Skew-T Log-P plot. The plot often includes guidelines that show how temperature tends to fall with altitude for dry and moist air. These can be used to predict icing, convective activity/thunderstorms, and wind shear, to start.

# What is this data?
## üéà Soundings
Weather balloons are released twice a day from dozens of locations around the US and hundreds around the world.

## üßÆ Forecasts
NOAA forecasts provide predicted sounding data on a grid. The default model (Op40) is hourly on a 40km grid for up to 18 hours in the future.

## üá∫üá∏ US only?
The sole data source is the US's NOAA. Forecast data is only available for the US, but 12 hour soundings _are_ available from US military bases all over the world.

# How was this app built?
## SwiftUI
- Fully declarative UI
- Immutable state managed via...

## Redux
- A dirt simple implementation of Redux, following this article: [Redux architecture and mind-blowing features](https://wojciechkulik.pl/ios/redux-architecture-and-mind-blowing-features)
- Every view uses a `@EnvironmentObject var store: Store<SkewtState>` with `@Published private(set) var state: State`
- Each UI action dispatches an `Action` to the store's `dispatch`
- Every state struct has a `Reducer` pure function to turn a `State` and an `Action` into a new `State`
- `Middleware`s handle remote data, saving state, logging, and handling location data

## Combine
- Network requests are all performed via `URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher`, mapping responses and failures to Redux actions
- Debounced UI is handled via bindings and Combine

# Privacy
- No user data is collected, period. This may be revisted later for anonymous analytics.
- User location, if granted, is anonymized before being sent to any external API.

# Free?
Skew-T Log-P plots will stay free as long as a free API exists. Future interactive lessons, quizzes, integrations with external tools, and more advanced visualizations may appear with a cost.
