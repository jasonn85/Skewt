# Skew-TÂ²
An open-source, iOS app for viewing sounding data and forecasts from NOAA

## What is a Skew-T Log-P plot?
If weather is the Matrix, reading a Skew-T Log-P chart is reading the green text. Metereologists and glider pilots understand. Pilots all should!

### The lines
The two plotted lines are temperature and moisture (dew point). Height is height. (Pressure is plotted logarithmically, hence Log-P). Left is cold; right is hot. Temperature is skewed so that a constant temperature atmosphere would slope up and to the right, hence Skew-T.

### Lines touch = clouds
The temperature falling to the dew point makes clouds/dew/precipitation. This would be shown as the temperature plot touching the dew point plot:

Low clouds:
_TODO: sample plot_

High clouds:
_TODO: sample plot_

Rain:
_TODO: sample plot_

### The other lines
All sorts of other weather characteristics are easily identifiable on a Skew-T Log-P plot. The plot often includes guidelines that show how temperature tends to fall with altitude for dry and moist air. These can be used to predict icing, convective activity/thunderstorms, and wind shear, to start.

### What is this data?
#### Soundings
Weather balloons are released twice a day from dozens of locations around the US and hundreds around the world.

#### Forecasts
NOAA forecasts provide predicted sounding data on a grid. The default model (Op40) is hourly on a 40km grid for up to 18 hours in the future.

## How was this app built?
### SwiftUI

### Redux
- A custom implementation of Redux was built, following this article: [Redux architecture and mind-blowing features](https://wojciechkulik.pl/ios/redux-architecture-and-mind-blowing-features)
- Every view uses a `Store` `@EnvironmentObject` with one immutable state
- Each UI action dispatches an `Action` to the store
- Every state struct has a `Reducer` pure function to turn a `State` and an `Action` into a new `State`
- `Middleware`s handle remote data, saving state, logging, and handling location data

### Combine
- Network requests are all performed via `URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher`, mapping responses and failures to Redux actions
- Debounced UI is handled via bindings and Combine, e.g.
```swift     
debouncer = $timeInterval
	.debounce(for: .seconds(0.2), scheduler: RunLoop.main)
	.removeDuplicates()
	.sink(receiveValue: { [weak self] in
	    self?.store?.dispatch(SoundingState.Action.changeAndLoadSelection(.selectTime(.relative($0))))
	})
```
